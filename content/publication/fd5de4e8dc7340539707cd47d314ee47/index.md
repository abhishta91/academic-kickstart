abstract: "We conduct longitudinal and temporal analyses on active DNS measurement data to investigate how the Russia-Ukraine conflict impacted the network infrastructures supporting domain names under ICANN's CZDS new gTLDs. Our findings revealed changes in the physical locations of network infrastructures, utilization of managed DNS services, infrastructure redundancy, and distribution, which started right after the first reported Russian military movements in February 2022. We also found that domains from different countries had varying location preferences when moving their hosting infrastructure. These observed changes suggest that network operators took proactive measures in anticipation of an armed conflict to promote resilience and protect the sovereignty of their networks in response to the conflict."
