abstract: "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks may lead to massive economic damages to victims. In most cases, the damage caused is dictated by the circumstances surrounding the attack (i.e. context). One of the ways of collecting information on the context of an attack can be by using the online articles written about the attack. In this poster, we introduce a dataset collected using Google Alerts that provides contextual information related DDoS attacks. The goal of the poster is to invite other researchers for collaboration"
