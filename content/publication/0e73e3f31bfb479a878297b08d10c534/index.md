abstract: "DDoS attacks could have an economic motive such as extortion, but also social and political such as hacktivism and state-sponsored warfare. Hence, the monetary value of the targets does not always explain the victimization. To counter DDoS threats, cloud providers utilize more robust, distributed networks and implement DDoS evasion techniques such as Anycast. However, by hosting many targets under a single infrastructure, they also accumulate threats, which together might exceed the ability of the infrastructure. We approach the victimization problem by using VIVA (value, inertia, visibility, and access) attributes of the DDoS victims to understand what makes them a suitable target for DDoS attacks. We conduct a large-scale analysis of DDoS attack incidents inferred from traffic data recorded by a network telescope over a five-year period. Using Alexa rank and content category of the domain names associated with the targeted IP addresses, we infer the targets' popularity and industry sector to estimate their VIVA attributes, especially, visibility and value. We reveal that more popular domain names suffer more DDoS attacks but during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observe more attacks targeting domain names regardless of their popularity. Our analysis of the top 100K most popular domain names shows that certain industry sectors have significantly higher threats of DDoS attacks and even repeat victimization. We also investigate the accumulated threats among cloud/data center providers and find that the proportion of customers from specific industry sectors statistically increases the threat of DDoS attacks for these providers significantly."
