 abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks provide an easy option for these criminals to disrupt the business of these online platforms. We analyse the economic impact of DDoS attacks on a crypto-currency exchange using event analysis. Our contributions are fourfold: Firstly, we develop an estimation model utilising ideas from behavioural finance to predict volume of crypto-currency traded on the basis of changes in price. Secondly, we perform an event analysis to evaluate whether there is an impact of a DDoS attack on the volume traded on the exchange in 17 different cases. Thirdly, we find that in 13 cases the negative impact due to a DDoS attack is recovered within the same day by the exchange. Finally, we evaluate hourly trade data to show why in most cases the volume traded recovers within a single day. Â© 2019 IEEE.},
