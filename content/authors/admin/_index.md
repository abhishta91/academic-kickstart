I am an assistant professor at the *Industrial Engineering and Business Information Systems* group at *University of Twente*.
My research focuses on empirically measuring the economic/financial impact of cyber attacks. In order to do so I device/adapt data-driven economic impact assessment techniques. I look to help organisations make well-measured investments in security.
My doctoral research was funded under NWO project *D3 – Distributed Denial-of-Service Defense: protecting schools and other public organizations*. You can access a copy of his doctoral thesis [here](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/158275031/main_openany.pdf "The Blind Man and The Elephant: Measuring Economic Impacts of DDoS Attacks").
Other than finding (un)cool methods of finding the “devil” in financial details I am also involved in teaching and guiding students. From time to time I also deliver lectures to executives and collaborate with companies to help them with security decision making. I am also a member of *behavioural data science incubator* at the faculty of *BMS* at the university, where I contribute to solving social science problems using data science. Today's presentation is [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/HrBDc7D7fwTePZl).
