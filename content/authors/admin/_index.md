I am an assistant professor of finance and cyber risk management at University of Twente. I am a member of hightech business and entrepreneurship (HBE) department at the faculty of behavioural management and social sciences (BMS). My research interests include applied finance, security economics and network security. I am interested in empirically measuring the economic impact of cyber attacks on public private organisations. My research helps organisations in cyber security decision-making.
