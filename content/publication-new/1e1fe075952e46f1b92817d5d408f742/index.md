abstract: "Robotic process automation (RPA) is often used by organisations to automate standard and repetitive business processes with the aim of improving firm performance. In some firms, processes such as invoice processing, onboarding and payment reminder notification are no longer required to be performed by humans. A successful implementation of RPA results in benefits such as FTE savings and increased employee satisfaction. However, when the wrong processes are chosen to be automated, the RPA implementation process becomes tedious and non-rewarding. Organisations often tend to select processes that are too complex or that require tasks necessitating human interventions. A miss-assessment in selection of a business process for automation leads to overly long development time and maintenance-intensive digital robots. Currently used process selection methods - such as interviews and process mining - might help with the identification of suitable processes, but are time consuming, complex, unsystematic and dependent on the individual. This book chapter discusses the different process selection methods covered in literature and suggests a workshop design that can be utilised to select business processes suitable for RPA implementation. The proposed workshop-based process selection method takes into consideration the recommendations of multiple stakeholders of a business process, evaluating the complexity of a business process to RPA fit and providing insights on expected benefits of RPA implementation."
