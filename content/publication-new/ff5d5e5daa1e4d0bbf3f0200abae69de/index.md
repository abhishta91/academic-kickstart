abstract: "Organizations are under constant threat of cyberattacks. Hence, they need to have information security measures put in place. Security managers lack methods to quantify how much effort should be invested in protecting their IT assets and training people. We propose developing a metric-based method to guide cybersecurity investments, aimed at improving an organization's security posture."
