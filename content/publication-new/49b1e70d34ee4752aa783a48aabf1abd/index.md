abstract: "The rapid growth of digital transformations globally has compelled European policymakers to discuss the possibility of a “Digitally Sovereign” model of the Internet. However, both policymakers and researchers have yet to solidify the concept behind such an ecosystem. While recent policies on digital issues often center around {\"}Digital Sovereignty,{\"} there remains a lack of clear distinction between this term and similar concepts such as {\"}Data Sovereignty{\"} and {\"}Technological Sovereignty{\"}. This extended abstract proposes a thorough textual analysis of EU policy documents to grasp the values and principles behind Digital Sovereignty."
