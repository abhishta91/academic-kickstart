abstract: "This paper examines the European Union's (EU) concept of digital sovereignty through an analysis of 79 legal documents selected via a rigorous screening process. By evaluating mentions of Digital Sovereignty in these documents, this study identifies four key motivations: increasing foreign digital dependencies, lack of common governance, insufficient security amid rising threats, and the growing social and economic impact of technology. Using Gioia methodology, it recognises six dimensions for EU's strategic goals: data control, democratic digital transformation, open strategic autonomy, a digital single market, building own digital capacities, and enhancing cybersecurity & resilience. Our analysis of EU legal documents offers a systematic interpretation of the term “Digital Sovereignty” by differentiating at policy, organisational, and individual levels, providing guidance towards building resilient telecommunication systems."
