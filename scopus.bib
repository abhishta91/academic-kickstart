abstract={Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to the availability of online resources. In this paper, we analyse the attacker aims for the use of DDoS attacks. We propose a model that can be used to evaluate news articles for determining probable aims of attackers. Thereafter, we apply this model to evaluate 27 distinct attack events from 2016. We make use of a DDoS specific longitudinal news database to select these attack events. We find the proposed model useful in analysing attack aims. We also find that in some cases attackers might target a web infrastructure just because it is virtually invincible. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={We study the influence of daily routines of Dutch academic institutions on the number of DDoS attacks targeting their infrastructures. We hypothesise that the attacks are motivated and harness the postulates of Routine Activity Theory (RAT) from criminology to analyse the data. We define routine periods in order to group days with similar activities and use 2.5 years of NetFlow alerts data measured by SURFnet to compare the number of alerts generated during each of these periods. Our analysis shows clear correlation between academic schedules and attack patterns on academic institutions. This leads us to believe that most of these attacks are not random and are initiated by someone who might benefit by disrupting scheduled educational activities. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks provide an easy option for these criminals to disrupt the business of these online platforms. We analyse the economic impact of DDoS attacks on a crypto-currency exchange using event analysis. Our contributions are fourfold: Firstly, we develop an estimation model utilising ideas from behavioural finance to predict volume of crypto-currency traded on the basis of changes in price. Secondly, we perform an event analysis to evaluate whether there is an impact of a DDoS attack on the volume traded on the exchange in 17 different cases. Thirdly, we find that in 13 cases the negative impact due to a DDoS attack is recovered within the same day by the exchange. Finally, we evaluate hourly trade data to show why in most cases the volume traded recovers within a single day. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose a serious threat to the availability of Internet services. The Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the core of the Internet and a crucial factor in the successful delivery of Internet services. Because of the importance of DNS, specialist service providers have sprung up in the market, that provide managed DNS services. One of their key selling points is that they protect DNS for a domain against DDoS attacks. But what if such a service becomes the target of a DDoS attack, and that attack succeeds? In this paper we analyse two such events, an attack on NS1 in May 2016, and an attack on Dyn in October 2016. We do this by analysing the change in the behaviour of the service's customers. For our analysis we leverage data from the OpenINTEL active DNS measurement system, which covers large parts of the global DNS over time. Our results show an almost immediate and statistically significant change in the behaviour of domains that use NS1 or Dyn as a DNS service provider. We observe a decline in the number of domains that exclusively use NS1 or Dyn as a managed DNS service provider, and see a shift toward risk spreading by using multiple providers. While a large managed DNS provider may be better equipped to protect against attacks, these two case studies show they are not impervious to them. This calls into question the wisdom of using a single provider for managed DNS. Our results show that spreading risk by using multiple providers is an effective countermeasure, albeit probably at a higher cost. © 2018 E-flow ACM (Association for Computing Machinery).

abstract={Botnets continue to be an active threat against firms or companies and individuals worldwide. Previous research regarding botnets has unveiled information on how the system and their stakeholders operate, but an insight on the economic structure that supports these stakeholders is lacking. The objective of this research is to analyse the business model and determine the revenue stream of a botnet owner. We also study the botnet life-cycle and determine the costs associated with it on the basis of four case studies. We conclude that building a full scale cyber army from scratch is very expensive where as acquiring a previously developed botnet requires a little cost. We find that initial setup and monthly costs were minimal compared to total revenue. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are responsible for creating unavailability of online resources. Botnets based on internet of things (IOT) devices are now being used to conduct DDoS attacks. The estimation of direct and indirect economic damages caused by these attacks is a complex problem. In this article we analyze the impact of 45 different DDoS attack announcements on victim firm’s stock prices using three different approaches and compare the results. We show that the assumption of cumulative abnormal returns being normally distributed leads to overestimation/underestimation of the impact. We solve this problem by using an empirical distribution of cumulative abnormal returns for hypothesis testing. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of DDoS attack announcements in each of the cases. © 2017, Journal of Wireless Mobile Networks, Ubiquitous Computing, and Dependable Applications.

abstract={DDoS attacks are increasingly used by 'hackers' and 'hacktivists' for various purposes. A number of on-line tools are available to launch an attack of significant intensity. These attacks lead to a variety of losses at the victim's end. We analyse the impact of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack announcements over a period of 5 years on the stock prices of the victim firms. We propose a method for event studies that does not assume the cumulative abnormal returns to be normally distributed, instead we use the empirical distribution for testing purposes. In most cases we find no significant impact on the stock returns but in cases where a DDoS attack creates an interruption in the services provided to the customer, we find a significant negative impact. © 2017 IEEE.},
