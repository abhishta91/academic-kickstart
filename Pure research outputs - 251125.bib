@phdthesis{081dbbfb1d584a4e991f61c37ea22ec9,  title     = "The Blind Man and The Elephant: Measuring Economic Impacts of DDoS Attacks",  abstract  = "Internet has become an important part of our everyday life. We use services like Netflix, Skype, online banking and Scopus etc. daily. We even use Internet for filing our tax returns and communicating with municipalities. This dependency on network-based technologies provides an opportunity to malicious actors in our society to remotely attack IT infrastructure. One type of cyberattack that may lead to unavailability of network resources is known as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. A DDoS attack leverages many computers to launch a coordinated Denial of Service attack against one or more targets. These attacks cause damages to victim businesses. According to reports published by several consultancies and security companies these attacks lead to millions of dollars in losses every year. One might ponder: are the damages caused by temporary unavailability of network services really this large? One of the points of criticism for these reports has been that they often base their findings on victim surveys and expert opinions. Now, as cost accounting/book keeping methods are not focused on measuring the impact of cyber security incidents, it is highly likely that surveys are unable to capture the true impact of an attack. A troubling fact is that most C-level managers make budgetary decisions for security based on the losses reported in these surveys. Several inputs for security investment decision models such as return on security investment (ROSI) also depend on these figures. This makes the situation very similar to the parable of the blind men and the elephant, in which several blind men try to conceptualise how the elephant looks like by touching it. Hence, it is important to develop methodologies that capture the true impact of DDoS attacks. In this thesis, we study the economic impact of DDoS attacks on public/private organisations by using an empirical approach. In Chapter 1 we explain the motivation for our work and illustrate the problems associated with measuring the economic impacts of DDoS attacks. We then formulate our main research question and break it down into sub-questions that we investigate in later chapters. We state our main research question as follows: What are the economic impacts of DDoS attacks on public/private organisations? Our first contribution is identifying the main stakeholders in a DDoS attack. In Chapter 2, we discuss the evolution of DDoS attacks in the last decade and briefly describe the strategies adopted by attackers and defenders. By studying the business model of a botnet, we also analyse how DDoS attacks can be used by attackers for monetary gains. Our second contribution is to develop methodologies to capture the direct impact of DDoS attacks. In Chapters 3 and 4 we measure the direct consequences of DDoS attacks on large managed domain name service (DNS) providers and a cryptocurrency exchange respectively. We find that a successful DDoS attack on a managed DNS service provider, changes the security behaviour of its customers. In the case of cryptocurrency exchange we find that the losses are recovered very quickly, on most instances even within a single day. We show how longitudinal datasets can be used to asses the impacts. The third contribution of this thesis is to develop methodologies to measure the indirect consequences of DDoS attacks. In Chapter 5, we propose a more robust event study approach and use it to analyse the impact of DDoS attack announcements on victims' stock prices. We find that in most cases this impact is short lived (5-10 days). In Chapter 6, we introduce a dataset based on web articles on DDoS attacks which captures the social context of an attack. We show how machine learning algorithms can be used to filter news articles that are reporting a DDoS attack from the dataset. We recognise that it is not possible to measure the true impact of DDoS attacks on the victim without learning about the aims of attackers. In Chapter 7, we propose a model based on Routine Activity Theory (RAT) to study attacker's aims by using the information about the attack reported in the news articles. Later in Chapter 8, we show how postulates of RAT may be used to explain DDoS attack trends on educational institutions. Our results show that DDoS attacks are not a random phenomenon and attackers are instigated by the circumstances surrounding them. We observe that measuring the true economic impact of these attacks is complex and requires us to consider the context of an attack. Some of the consequences of short duration IT unavailability are temporary and they are recovered rather quickly. Hence, to take this work forward we propose to give economic meaning to the empirical data that is presently available and collect more data at employee level to measure the resilience of firms towards IT unavailability.

Maar een statistische samenhang betekent niet noodzakelijk causaliteit. Meer gedetailleerd onderzoek is nodig om te kunnen reconstrueren wat door wie en wanneer is gedaan. De resultaten van dit onderzoek kunnen de opsporing versterken door de setting en de sequentie van delicten en gerelateerde gebeurtenissen beter te beschrijven en te begrijpen. Daardoor kan de focus van opsporing worden verscherpt. Daarnaast zou er meer aandacht kunnen zijn voor het feit dat de ene aanval de ander kan inluiden. Dankzij een beter begrip van de misdaadketens en gerelateerde gebeurtenissen kunnen barri{\`e}remodellen worden ontwikkeld ten behoeve van de bestrijding van phishing en DDoS aanvallen.

Just like any other business, these malicious actors strategically manage their processes in order to maximise their revenues. Coordinating different types of cybercrimes as part of a single attack campaign provides another opportunity to these criminal groups to improve the efficiency of their attacks. To investigate the promise of this “coordination” between cybercrimes in improving the financial gains realised by cybercriminals, we take a two-step approach. First, we perform a bibliometric analysis of past scientific literature discussing the concept of “coordination” w.r.t to cybercrime. Second, as a case study, analysing the attack chains of DDoS, phishing and ransomware attacks, we identify vantage points for potential coordination from an attacker{\textquoteright}s perspective. Based on our findings, we propose a model (COORDINATE) to identify the types of potential cybercrime “coordinations”. COORDINATE considers three relevant types of coordination: direct collaborated coordination, indirect collaborated coordination, and opportunistic coordination. Given the advantages of coordinated attacks, our results suggest that one crime may provide opportunities for the next one.

Our analysis revealed correlations between two properties of domains – industry sector and popularity – and post-attack strategies. Specifically, owners of more popular domains were more likely to re-act to increase the diversity of their authoritative DNS service for their domains. Similarly, domains in certain industry sectors were more likely to seek out such diversity in their DNS service.

So far only a few empirical studies have analysed the financial impact of ransomware attacks. This study aims to understand the expected financial gains for attackers and financial losses of victims after a ransomware attack. To do so, we build a dataset based on 453 ransomware attack investigation reports in the Netherlands reported to the Dutch Police between 2019 and 2022. Using rational choice model of crime (RCM) and crime scripting we hypothesise that the effort of an attacker, victim characteristics and context variables influence not only the ransom requested by an attacker but also the financial losses reported by victims. We use generalised linear models to evaluate and quantify this influence. Our results show that attacker's efforts such as using Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and victim characteristics such as industry sector, contribute to the ransom requested by attackers and financial losses reported by victims. We also show that the availability of recoverable backups explains the likelihood of victims paying the ransom. A limitation of the present study is the interpretation of the results due to selection bias of victims willing to report to the police. Despite this limitation, we argue that our methodology and results lay the groundwork for future large-scale empirical studies and add to our understanding of attacker and victim behaviour.

However, when the wrong processes are chosen to be automated, the RPA implementation process becomes tedious and non-rewarding. Organisations often tend to select processes that are too complex or that require tasks necessitating human interventions. A miss-assessment in selection of a business process for automation leads to overly long development time and maintenance-intensive digital robots. Currently used process selection methods - such as interviews and process mining - might help with the identification of suitable processes, but are time consuming, complex, unsystematic and dependent on the individual.

ET has several advantages: it is portable, non-invasive, simple to use and relatively inexpensive. ET has a cost ranging between €100 and 30,000 euros, depending on the level of the technology and whether the software to acquire and analyse data is included1. An ET experiment needs only a technician and, eventually, a data analyst. The average time needed to perform an ET experiment is about 15 min since the subject set-up is very fast. This time covers only the time needed to perform the experiment by the subject. Not all the ET has a high flexibility as some ET models might not work efficiently with glasses and contact lenses. ET is also characterized by a high level of integration with other tools due to its portability and because it is a “ready-to-use” device. To have more reliable results, ET should be used in combination with other tools.” The authors apologize for these errors and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way.

We use a signaling game to understand the strategies both parties use when dealing with uncertain information. We identify five distinct equilibria, each characterized by the criminals' varied approaches to signaling data exfiltration, influenced by the strategic parameters inherent in each attack scenario. Calibrating the game parameters with real-world like values, we identify the most probable equilibrium, offering insights into anticipated ransom amounts and corresponding payoffs for both victims and criminals.

To address this challenge, this study conducts various analyses on scan results of publicly shared malware samples. Utilizing metadata from 635K samples sourced from MalwareBazaar and scan results from VirusTotal, we assign family labels using AVClass. Additionally, we examine a 90-day longitudinal dataset alongside the main dataset. Our findings demonstrate that while over 60\% of scanner engines detect 67\% of samples, certain malware families consistently exhibit lower detection rates. Detection capability improves over time, particularly within the initial 30 days, but remains inadequate for specific families. Furthermore, we observe that some scanner engines demonstrate nearly flawless detection capability across all malware families, while the majority struggle with efficiently detecting certain types. Moreover, we performed Monte Carlo simulations and revealed that employing multiple scanner engines substantially enhances detection capability, with 3 to 7 scanners being optimal.

Mitigation efforts aim to reduce the profitability of ransomware attacks. Nevertheless, limited research has analysed factors that influence the size of ransom and willingness of businesses to pay a ransom. This study aims to address this existing gap by conducting an empirical investigation that focuses on the ransom paid by victims. Extending on past research, we analyse 382 ransomware attacks reported to the Dutch Police and/or handled by an Incident Response (IR) company. One challenge of modeling ransom payments is the large proportion of victims who did not pay, which leads to zero-inflation. We tackled this problem by employing a hurdle model, which effectively deals with zero-inflation by capturing ransom paid as a two-step decision-making process: first, victims decide whether to comply with the ransom demands, and if they choose to do so, they then need to determine the acceptable ransom amount. The results indicate that the presence of backups and the decision to go to an IR company play a pivotal role in the decision whether to pay the ransom or not. In addition, our findings identify insurance coverage, data exfiltration, and annual revenue of the victim as key determinants affecting the ransom amounts. Specifically, having insurance results in ransoms that are 2.8 times larger, data exfiltration corresponds to a 5.5 times increase in the ransom, and each 1\% increase in a victim's yearly revenue causes a 0.12\% rise in the ransom paid. In concluding our paper, we present practical policy recommendations that take into account the two crucial decision-making steps outlined in our study, focusing on data exfiltration and insurance.",  author    = "Tom Meurs and Edward Cartwright and Anna Cartwright and Marianne Junger and Raphael Hoheisel and Erik Tews and Abhishta Abhishta",  year      = "2024",  month     = apr,  day       = "1",  doi       = "10.1109/eCrime61234.2023.10485506",  language  = "English",  isbn      = "979-8-3503-6028-8",  series    = "Proceedings APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)",  publisher = "IEEE",  booktitle = "2023 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)",  address   = "United States",  note      = "18th Symposium on Electronic Crime Research, eCrime 2023, eCrime 2023 ; Conference date: 15-11-2023 Through 17-11-2023",}
